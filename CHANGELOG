Revision history for pyFreenet

- Version 0.3.1
    - adding a freesite inserts it right away
    - mime-type fixes

- Version 0.3.0
    - completely reviewed (ArneBab)
    - copyweb utility for using wget to mirror sites
    - fcpupload utility to conveniently upload a file to a CHK
    - freesitemgr uses default manifest putter for optimized sites.
    - fcpupload provides the key after queueing the file (except if called with -w)
    - man-page uses the general install rules instead of hand-crafted cp.

- Version 0.2.5
    - added 'noderefbot' - an IRC bot which swaps noderefs automatically

- Version 0.2.4

    - minor bugfix release
    - freesitemgr: now saving updated freesite edition numbers in
      ~/.freesitemgr/<sitename>

- Version 0.2.3

    - added 'fproxyproxy' shim atop fproxy, which should be used as
      a browser proxy, not surfed directly

- Version 0.2.2

    - added 'name services layer' (see 'fcpnames' manpage)
    - integrated this layer into .get()/.put() methods (and
      consequently, into fcpget and fcpput
    - added the utility 'fcpnames', allowing easy management
      of name services

- Version 0.2.1

    - added commands 'help' and 'cleanup' to freesitemgr
    - moved fcpget/fcpput/etc into modules in package fcp, leaving simple
      2-liner front-ends

- Version 0.2

    - added another layer of recovery to freesitemgr, to re-submit
      jobs the node forgets about (ie, losts from its queue)
    - added '-C' option to freesitemgr, to suit its use in crontab entries

- Version 0.1.8

    - another rework of freesitemgr:
        - inserts use only the global queue
        - 'freesitemgr update' exits immediately, leaving jobs on queue
        - extensive accounting, which recognises and compensates for node
          failures
        - you can now safely cron 'freesitemgr update'

- Version 0.1.7

    - rewrote most of freesitemgr:
        - now uses directory ~/.freesitemgr/
        - keeps track of all inserts
        - if interrupted, or if node dies, will resume where
          it left off
        - simplified options

- Version 0.1.6

    - now storing manifests in .freesites (for freesitemgr)
    - freesitemgr now issues progress messages with '-v' set
    - all utils now accept multiple occurrences of '-v' option, with
      increasing verbosity
    - added timeout option to get/put (and '-t' to fcpget/fcpput)

- Version 0.1.5

    - added global queue and persistence support for fcpget/fcpput
    - added 'nowait' option to fcpput

- Version 0.1.4

    - added manpages for console programs
    - improved mimetype determination algorithm for fcp put
    - added 'freedisk', a rudimentary linux filesystem that maps freenet
      into a mountable fs - limited functionality at present
    - added support for use of env vars FCP_HOST and FCP_PORT for specifying
      FCP host/port - useful for people who access FCP across a LAN, since
      it avoids annoyance of having to specify -H or -P with each command

- Version 0.1.3

    - added 'fcpget' and 'fcpput' command-line key retrieve/insert apps
    - added 'freesitemgr' command-line freesite insertion app
    - several bug fixes

    - added xmlrpc server app
    - added xmlrpc server CGI module (for embedding a Freenet XML-RPC
      server into websites)
    - added 'freesitemgr', a console freesite insertion app

- Version 0.1.1
    - 2006-May-13
